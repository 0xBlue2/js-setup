basic js for chall

## TODO: make interact-remote.js script

## SETUP:
- _install ethers_
  - `npm install ethers` (makes `node_modules` dir to use ethers in that dir only)
  - __or__ `sudo npm install ethers -g` (idk how this works, but it makes ethers lib accessible from anywhere)

- _"install" ganache_
  - ganache sets up a test blockchain locally and gives you a nice gui to see it
  - dont really need to "install" for linux, its just a standalone appimage
  - __get from: [https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)__
  
- _optional: install vscode extension(not available in `code-oss` from kali, have to use propietary version from msft)_
